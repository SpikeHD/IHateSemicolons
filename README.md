# IHateSemicolons
Stretching different languages to some weird limits by not using semicolons. At all.

# How does it work?

Most (if not, all) of these examples take advantage of the fact that, in most languages, all kinds of code can be evaluated inside of `if`, `while`, `for`, etc. This means that, in theory, a lot of these languages with so-called "strict semicolon requirements" are actually just lying to you. You can treat every language like JavaScript if you try hard enough.
