# JS, semicolon-less

Yes, before you make an issue, I know JS already doesn't require semicolons. Instead, I wanted to use this section to show how one can use the comma operator to write semicolon-less JS.

Typescript will scream and cry about this. Let it.

## Tested on
* NodeJS v18.13.0
* Firefox 120.0.1
