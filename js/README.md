# JS, semicolon-less

Yes, before you make an issue, I know JS already doesn't require semicolons. Instead, I wanted to use this section to show how one can use the comma operator to end JS lines (the superior way) instead of semicolons.

Typescript will scream and cry about this. Let it.

## Tested on
* NodeJS v18.13.0
* Firefox 120.0.1
